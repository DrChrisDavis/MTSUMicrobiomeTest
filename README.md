# MTSUMicrobiomeTest
A test repository for all the GitHub newbs looking to get some files and sequences for their science needs. Chris Davis (Dr. Chris to you)
is currently handling this because he is bored and has free time. Brockapotamus Arivett, Desta "It's a scam" Kidane, and Pratima Chapagain
are the real lead on this, maybe an MTSU professor somewhere, but what do they know?
